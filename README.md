# Rust project template

Basic template for Rust projects using cargo workspaces.

When I was looking around for a good standard set of lining rules to use for my Rust project templates I stumbled upon one of [Embark Studios github issues](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues/59). They seem to have a bunch of rust projects and have working on a standardized set of linting rules. So I've just copied their rules for now, with some additions of my own. All of which may change at any point in time.

Mostly I'm just looking for this template to be a good starting point for a new Rust repo. Nothing here is necessarily set in stone.

Feel free to use this template for your own projects if you feel like it. I'm open to ideas and criticism, so leave an issue if you want to discuss something.
